# FAIRgit - The SysBio-FAIRPlex GitHub Organization Structure and Standards

This is a standard setting document for all github repos coming on to the SysBio-FAIRplex ecosystem.
All technical documentation and publicly shareable artifacts will be published here and minted with DOIs at milestones of substantial revision.
Everything from code for analyses to data inventories and even lab documentation should be pushlished to this github organization as part of our efforts to maximize transparency and reproducibility.
Let's go **open science**!

**Please read below before your first commit (3 minute read only)!**

## Overview

FAIRgit serves as the central GitHub organization for the SysBio FAIRplex Project, designed to promote collaborative, transparent, and reproducible research following FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. This document outlines the organizational structure, development workflows, and coding standards that govern all repositories within the FAIRgit ecosystem.

## Organization Structure

### Team-Based Repository Organization

The FAIRgit organization is structured around seven primary areas, each corresponding to the specialized teams within the SysBio FAIRplex Project:

#### 1. Prime Platforms (`prime-platforms/`)
- **Purpose**: Core infrastructure and foundational platforms
- **Repository naming**: `prime-*` or `platform-*`
- **Access**: Team leads + designated developers

#### 2. Science, Harmonization and Search (`science-harmonization/`)
- **Purpose**: Data harmonization tools, search algorithms, and scientific methodology
- **Repository naming**: `sci-*`, `harmonize-*`, or `search-*`
- **Access**: Science team + collaborating researchers

#### 3. Program Management and Operations (`program-ops/`)
- **Purpose**: Project management tools, operational scripts, and administrative resources
- **Repository naming**: `ops-*`, `mgmt-*`, or `admin-*`
- **Access**: Program managers + operations team

#### 4. Portal and Knowledge Transfer (`portal-kt/`)
- **Purpose**: User interfaces, web portals, documentation sites, and knowledge dissemination tools
- **Repository naming**: `portal-*`, `web-*`, or `docs-*`
- **Access**: Portal development team + UX designers

#### 5. Governance and Standards (`governance/`)
- **Purpose**: Policy documents, standards definitions, compliance tools
- **Repository naming**: `governance-*`, `standards-*`, or `policy-*`
- **Access**: Governance committee + standards working groups

#### 6. Research Training and Outreach (`training-outreach/`)
- **Purpose**: Educational materials, training modules, workshop content
- **Repository naming**: `training-*`, `education-*`, or `workshop-*`
- **Access**: Training coordinators + educational content developers

#### 7. External Collaborators (`external-collab/`)
- **Purpose**: Forked repositories and collaborative spaces for external partners
- **Repository naming**: `collab-*`, `external-*`, or `partner-*`
- **Access**: Approved external collaborators + project liaisons

## Management and Governance

### Organization Administration
- **Primary Administrators**: Representatives from the Program Management and Operations team
- **Secondary Administrators**: Designated leads from each subteam
- **Review Committee**: Cross-team representatives for major organizational decisions

### Access Control
- **Team Leads**: Full access to their team's repositories
- **Developers**: Write access to assigned repositories
- **Collaborators**: Read access with specific write permissions as needed
- **External Partners**: Limited access to designated collaboration repositories

## Development Workflow

### Repository Lifecycle

#### 1. Development Phase (Private Repositories)
- All new development begins in **private staging repositories**
- Repository naming: `staging-[team-prefix]-[project-name]`
- Access limited to development team and designated reviewers
- Regular commits with descriptive messages following conventional commit standards

#### 2. Code Review Process
- **Mandatory peer review**: Minimum 2 reviewers from the relevant team
- **Cross-team review**: Required for repositories affecting multiple teams
- **Standards compliance check**: Automated testing for coding standards adherence
- **Documentation review**: Ensuring README and documentation completeness

#### 3. Production Release (Public Repositories)
- Upon successful review, code is merged to **public production repositories**
- Repository naming: `[team-prefix]-[project-name]`
- Comprehensive documentation and clear licensing
- Tagged releases with semantic versioning

### Branch Protection
- **Main/Master branch**: Protected, requires pull request and review
- **Development branches**: Feature-specific branches for active development
- **Release branches**: Stabilization branches for preparing releases

## README Standards and Template

### Required README Sections

All repositories must include a standardized README.md file with the following sections:

#### Standard README Template Structure:
```
# Repository Title

## Description
Brief description of the project and its purpose within the SysBio FAIRplex Project.

Step-by-step installation instructions including dependencies.

## Usage
Clear examples of how to use the code/tools with sample commands or code snippets.

## Data Sources and Attribution
- List all data sources used
- Provide proper citations and attribution
- Include data licensing information

## Contributing
Guidelines for contributing to the project, including coding standards and pull request process.

## Reproducibility
- Instructions for reproducing analyses or results
- Environment specifications (requirements.txt, environment.yml, etc.)
- Version information for critical dependencies

## License
Clearly state the project license and any restrictions.

## Contact
Contact information for maintainers and relevant team / affiliation.

## Acknowledgments
Recognition of contributors, funding sources, and collaborating institutions.
```

### Example README Implementation

Here's how the template should be implemented following the Science, Harmonization and Search team naming conventions:

# sci-DataProcessor

## Description
A Python toolkit for harmonizing heterogeneous biological datasets as part of the SysBio FAIRplex Project's Science, Harmonization and Search initiative.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
